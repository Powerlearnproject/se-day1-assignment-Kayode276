Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is simply the systematic application of engineering principles to the design, development, testing, deployment and maintenance of software products.
Its importance in the technology industry cannot be overemphasized as it enables the creation of applications that helps to power various industries such as telecommunications, banking and finance, healthcare etc.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Development of programming languages e.g Fortran, C etc.
2. The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s.
3. The advent of structured programming in the 1970s.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirements- Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
2. Design- Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
3. Implementation- Writing code and building software according to the design specifications.
4. Testing- Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
5. Deployment- Releasing the software to users or customers.
6. Maintenance- Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall- This is a sequential approach with distinctphases (e.g., requirements, design, implementation) flowing downwards like a waterfall.
This methodolody is used in projects with clearly defined requirements that are unlikey to change, such as construction projects or projects with strict regulatory compliance
WHILE
Agile- this is iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change.
This methodology is used in projects whererequirements are expected to evolve or are not fully known ath the start, such as software development or product innovation projects.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer- Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer- Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager- Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)- These are software suits that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing code e.g Visual Studio, Atom, Codenvy
Version Control Systems (VCS)- These are software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members e.g Git, Perforce, Apache Subversion.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Changing requirements
2. Tight Deadlines
3. Technical debt
   SOLUTIONS
1. Agile methodologies
2. Prioritization of tasks and
3. Regular reassesment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit Testing- Testing individual components or modules of software
2. Integration Testing- Testing interactions between different components or subsystems
3. Sytem Testing- Testing the entire software system as a whole
4. Acceptance Testing- Testing the software against user reqirements to ensure it meets user needs.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is simply the concise crafting of questions or instructions in such a way that helps you get the best responses from your AI agent.
Prompt engineering is very important because it gives clarity and precision. Well-crafted prompts help in clearly difining the task or question, reducing ambiguity and accurate responses.



Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
VAGUE PROMPT- "Teach me how to cook"
IMPROVED PROMPT- "Teach me how to cook instant noodles"

Unlike the vague prompt which is quite ambiguous given the fact that there are numerous ways of cooking endless meals aroud the world, the improved prompt is more concise and easier for the AI model to run with.
